# UX Design and Implementation for a Tourism Website

Project Overview:

As part of a university project, I designed and developed a mobile-first website for Taniti, an imaginary island, to enhance its appeal to tourists and improve user experience. The project followed a structured UX process, including wireframe creation, guerrilla testing, interactive prototyping, and usability testing. The primary goal was to create an intuitive, accessible, and visually appealing design tailored to the needs of a target persona, a family-oriented traveler.

Achievements:

Successfully created a fully functional prototype that effectively guided users through key features, such as exploring attractions, booking lodging, and viewing transportation options.
Addressed actionable feedback from usability testing, such as improving navigation responsiveness, enhancing link visibility, and ensuring a consistent design across devices.
Designed a mobile-first layout that prioritized accessibility and clarity, resulting in a seamless user experience.
Challenges and Solutions:
One challenge was balancing simplicity with functionality to ensure users could easily navigate while accessing detailed information. I addressed this by iteratively refining the prototype based on feedback, such as improving the visibility of key links and adjusting CSS for better viewport compatibility.

Skills Gained:

Developed expertise in the end-to-end UX design process, from user research and wireframing to prototyping and testing.
Enhanced skills in mobile-first responsive design and accessibility principles.
Gained practical experience in incorporating user feedback into iterative design improvements.
Technologies and Tools Used:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating and styling the website.
Figma and hand-drawn sketches for wireframe development.
Usability testing techniques, including guerrilla testing and task-based feedback analysis.
Key Takeaway:
This project provided a deep understanding of how to design user-centered websites that are functional, accessible, and visually appealing. It also reinforced the importance of testing and iteration in creating a product that meets user needs and achieves business goals.
